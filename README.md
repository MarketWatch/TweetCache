To contribute to the project, first you need to set up the virtual environment. This setup assumes that you are using conda/miniconda distribution of Python.

To replicate the development virtual environment, enter the following command in your terminal:

```shell
conda create --name <envname> --file requirements.txt
```
Finally, once the environment is set up successfully, activate the environment using the following command:

```shell
conda activate <envname>
```
